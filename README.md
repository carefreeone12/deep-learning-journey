### 📘 About This Repository

**This repository serves as a central hub for my deep learning studies.**

As a student currently learning Deep Learning, I created this space to organize everything I am practicing. Instead of just reading about concepts, I am implementing them in code to truly understand how they work.

**What you will find here:**
This repository contains the code and resources from my daily practice, including:

* **Learning Implementations:** My personal code for building Neural Networks and CNNs from scratch to understand the architecture.
* **Practice Experiments:** Small projects where I test different models, tweak parameters, and evaluate the results to see what happens.
* **Study Notes & Resources:** A collection of things I have learned and applied using Python-based frameworks.

My goal is to document my entire learning curve—starting from the basics and gradually moving to more complex topics as I progress.
